Algorithm
The brute force approach is simple. 
Loop through each element x and find if there is another value that equals to targetâˆ’x.
Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: O(n^2).
For each element, we try to find its complement by looping through the rest of the array which takes O(n) time.
Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2).

Space complexity: O(1).
The space required does not depend on the size of the input array, so only constant space is used.
